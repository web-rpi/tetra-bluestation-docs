## [0.5.2] - 19/03/2026
### Added

## [0.5.1] - 19/03/2026
### Changed
- Major LLC layer revamp: transmission logic is now substantially more standards-compliant, including message withholding until a previous message has been acknowledged by the MS, and retransmission of lost messages.


## [0.5.0] - 13/03/2026
### Added
- SDS support, including interconnection with Brew.
- feature_sds_enabled flag in the [brew] configuration section, to disable SDS forwarding to Brew.
- UL inactivity timeout to detect stuck or disappeared radios mid-TX.
- LLC TX retransmission support for reliable message delivery
### Changed
- Brew default port updated to 443 and default username updated to SSID.
- Bitbuffer improvements.

## [0.4.10] - 10/03/2026
### Changed
- Scheduler improvements.

## [0.4.9] - 27/02/2026
### Added
- Dynamic ISSI → Brew attachment support.
- Improved filtering to control which ISSIs are routed to Brew and which remain local.

### Changed
- Removed the `issi` field from the `[brew]` configuration section: leaving this field in place will prevent the application from starting.
  
## [0.4.8] - 26/02/2026
### Added
- Support for uplink second-slot stealing (low-level feature).
- Receipt-based transmission tracking for CMCE/MM/SNDCP:
  - Allows components to retain a receipt when sending a message.
  - Enables verification that the message was transmitted over the air.
  - Tracks whether the MS acknowledged reception.
- Self-throttled D-SETUP repeats when MAC is heavily loaded (leveraging the new receipt mechanism).

### Changed
- Major configuration system rewrite.
- Improvements and updates to the unit testing framework.

## [0.4.6] - 24/02/2026
### Added
- Dynamic group attachment and detachment over Brew (no more hard-coded group configuration required).
- Optional SSI range configuration in `[cell]` to force traffic to remain local.
- Optional SSI whitelist in `[brew]` to restrict which SSIs may be routed through Brew.

### Changed
- Internal refactors and cleanup.

### Notes
- ISSI registration remains static for now; dynamic ISSI handling is planned for a future release.

## [0.4.5] - 23/02/2026
### Added
